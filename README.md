SiPac will is highly customizable PHP and AJAX chat. At this time, there aren't any plans to continue this Project. Please don't use it in Production.

If you wan't to try out the chat, download a released version from here: https://github.com/nexttrex/SiPac/releases

To setup the chat, create a new database, and import SiPac.sql located in the Root folder.
Open index.php with an editor and fill in the mysql username, password and database.
The chat is now ready.

You can also add some settings, but more information about that will be added later.
