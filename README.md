SiPac
=====

SiPac will be a highly customizable PHP and AJAX chat, but it's not ready to use, yet.

If you wan't to try out the chat, download a released version from here: https://github.com/nexttrex/SiPac/releases

To setup the chat, create a new database, and import SiPac.sql located in the Root folder.
Open index.php with an editor and fill in the mysql username, password and database.
The chat is now ready.

You can also add some settings, but more information about that will be added later.
